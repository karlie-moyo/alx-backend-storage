| 0x00  | [MySQL Advanced](./0x00-MySQL_Advanced/)                                                                                                               |**MySQL Advanced** covers advanced features of MySQL, including complex queries, indexing, optimization techniques, stored procedures, triggers, transactions, and replication, aimed at improving performance, scalability, and managing large databases effectively.|            
| 0x01  | [NoSQL](./0x01-NoSQL/)                                                                                                                     |**NoSQL** refers to non-relational databases designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly changing data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases (like **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, and **Redis**) offer flexibility in data models, scalability, and high performance for big data and real-time applications. They support key-value, document, column-family, or graph data models.|
| 0x02  | [Redis](./0x02-redis_basic/)                                                                                                                            |**Redis** is an open-source, in-memory data store used as a cache, message broker, or database. It supports various data structures like strings, lists, sets, hashes, and more. Redis is known for its high performance, low latency, and ability to handle real-time data processing, making it ideal for caching, session management, and queueing tasks. |
